Flask IMDb App Web
This project provides a Flask web application that reads IMDb export CSV files and serves them as a JSON list through a web interface. The app is designed to be run inside a Docker container, making it easy to deploy and manage in various environments.

Features
Parses IMDb export CSV files.
Serves movie data through a /get-list endpoint in JSON format.
Easy deployment via Docker.

Requirements
Docker installed on your system (Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, or Docker on a compatible server).

Project Structure
    
Setup Instructions
Build the Docker Image

To get started, build the Docker image for the Flask IMDb app:

docker build -t flask-imdb-app-web .
Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, run the Docker container. You'll need to map a directory from your host machine into the container where the IMDb export CSV files are stored.

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v /path/to/your/csvs:/app/imdb_exports flask-imdb-app-web

Replace /path/to/your/csvs with the actual path to the directory on your host machine where your IMDb export CSV files are stored.
./app/imdb_exports: This is the directory inside the container where the CSV files will be accessible.
Access the Application

After starting the container, the Flask application will be accessible via your web browser:
http

http://localhost:5000/get-list
If you're running the container on a remote server or in an environment like Unraid, replace localhost with the IP address of that server.
Troubleshooting
No CSV Files Found:

Ensure that the /path/to/your/csvs directory on your host is correctly mapped to /app/imdb_exports inside the container.
Verify that the CSV files are correctly placed in the directory you mapped.
